# Design catalogs — code-led sticker sheets per component system

A **design catalog** is a `samples/` module whose `@Preview`s exist to be
exported as an importable **sticker sheet**: every component of a system
(Compose M3, Wear Compose M3, Glimmer, Glance/Wear widgets) rendered in its
primary modes, in two variants (the `ideal` capture and the
`compose/semantics-wireframe` `layout` view), with the system's design tokens
(`compose/theme`) and accessibility findings (`a11y/*`) extracted from the
render.

The renderer here is the source of truth; the importable bundle is assembled by
[`@design-parity/catalog-export`](https://github.com/yschimke/design-parity/tree/main/packages/catalog-export),
and the workflow is documented by the `compose-design-catalog` skill in
[yschimke/skills](https://github.com/yschimke/skills). Published Figma kits are
seed/reference only — a kit/render divergence is a bug in the kit.

## Why a dedicated module per system

`@Preview` discovery is local-module only: the renderer sees previews compiled
into a module, not previews that live inside a library. So each system needs a
module that depends on its library and authors **one `@Preview` per component ×
primary mode**. Encode the modes with a shared multipreview annotation
(`@CatalogModes` → light + dark) and add per-component `@Preview`s for the states
and breakpoints that matter.

## Modules

| Module | System | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `samples/design-catalog-m3` | Compose Material 3 (+ Adaptive, planned) | ✅ template |
| `samples/design-catalog-wear-m3` | Wear Compose M3 | planned |
| `samples/design-catalog-glimmer` | Glimmer (Android XR) | planned (see `samples/xr-glimmer`) |
| `samples/design-catalog-glance` | Glance app widgets + Wear widgets | planned |

Each module carries a `catalog.spec.json` (the Phase-0 inventory: groups,
captions, primary modes, breakpoints, and the seed-kit frame per component).

## Rendering a catalog

```sh
# --module is the Gradle path (leading colon optional), not the bare name —
# the resolver maps it to a directory (`samples/design-catalog-m3`).
compose-preview show --module samples:design-catalog-m3 \
  --with-extension a11y,theme,semantics,semantics-wireframe --json \
  > /tmp/m3-show.json
```

- `capture` PNGs → the `ideal` variant.
- `compose/semantics-wireframe` → the `layout` (bordered) variant.
- `compose/theme` → the token set; `compose/semantics` → bounds / padding /
  `textOverflow` (maxLines); `a11y/atf` + `a11y/touchTargets` → greenlines.

Feed the result through `@design-parity/catalog-export` to produce the importable
bundle, and commit it to the system's `design-artifacts/<system>` delivery
branch.

## Adding a component

1. Author a `@Composable` wrapped in the module's sticker theme, annotated with
   `@CatalogModes` (and extra `@Preview`s for states / breakpoints).
2. Add it to `catalog.spec.json` under its group with a caption and, if known,
   the seed-kit frame reference.
3. The next render + export picks it up automatically — no harness change.
